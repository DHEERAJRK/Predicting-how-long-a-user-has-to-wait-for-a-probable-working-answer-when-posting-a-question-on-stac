Predicting how long a user has to wait for a probable working answer when posting a question on stack overflow,

Stack Overflow is a huge database of Questions and Answers and it really helps in finding answers related to the various topics of Computer Science.
However, Stack Overflow provides no means of expecting how soon a user can expect an answer as that is highly dependent on the nature and
commonality of tags in his question and how popular is that tag with the users, because naturally a follows stringent quality tests of
Questions asked, meaning off-topic questions, or questions which are similar to ones already asked (redundant) will be removed or closed very quickly. 
So in order to help a user know the time he/she would have to wait to get an answer we thought of using data analytics in finding 
detecting the quality and also estimate how soon he/she would get an answer.

We have analysed the data from the 2008 stack overflow data dump and have(based on the attribute values of the cleaned data) predicted
the time required by a user (who posted a question based on certain tags) to expect an answer.
We have used Linear regression to analyse.
